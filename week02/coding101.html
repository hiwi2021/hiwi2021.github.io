  <h1>New York-style Pizza.</h1>
  <h2><p style="color: blue;"> what's the different about New York pizza?</h2>
  <p>New York pizza is all about the hand-tossed, thin and floppy crust! It's perfect for on-the-go eating, which makes sense for the city that never sleeps!</p>
  <h2> What's the difference between New York and ChicagoPizza?</h2>
  <p>There is quite a difference between the two. New York-style pizza is known for being foldable and portable because of its thin crust. On the flip side, Chicago-style pizza is known for its heavy, deep-dish crust—it's one of the only types of pizza that you need to eat with a fork and knife! (Check out our guide to the different types of pizza from across America—because yes, there is a difference.)</p>
  <h1>Ingredients</h1>

  <ul>
  <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
  <li>2/3 cup warm water (110° to 115°)</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
  <li>1-3/4 to 2-1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 can (8 ounces) tomato sauce</li>
    <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
<li>1/2 cup grated Romano cheese</li>
<li>1/4 cup chopped fresh basil</li>
<li>2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
<li>1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
 </ul>

  <h1>Directions</h1>

  <ol>
  <li>In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. In a large bowl, combine oil, salt, yeast mixture and 1 cup flour; beat on medium speed until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough (dough will be sticky).</li>
    <li>Turn dough onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease the top.</li>
    <li>Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 475°. Grease a 14-in. pizza pan. Roll dough to fit pan. Pinch edge to form a rim.</li>
    <li> Cover and let rest 10 minutes. Spread with tomato sauce; top with cheeses, basil, oregano and pepper flakes. </li>
    <li>Bake on a lower oven rack until crust is lightly browned and cheese is melted, 15-20 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes before slicing.</li>
  </ol>
